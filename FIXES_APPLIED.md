# Booking System Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Authentication & RLS Policy Issues
- **Problem**: 401 Unauthorized and RLS policy violations when creating bookings
- **Solution**: Updated RLS policies to allow anonymous users to create bookings
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `lib/supabase.ts` - Updated client configuration
  - `complete-schema.sql` - Fixed RLS policies for bookings table

### 2. Missing React Import
- **Problem**: React hooks not working due to missing import
- **Solution**: Added proper React import with useState
- **Files Modified**: `pages/index.tsx`

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness Issues
- **Problem**: Poor mobile experience with small touch targets and cramped layout
- **Solution**: Enhanced mobile-first design with:
  - Larger touch targets (min 48px height)
  - Better spacing and padding
  - Responsive grid layouts
  - Improved focus states
  - Better modal sizing for mobile
- **Files Modified**: `pages/index.tsx`

## IMPORTANT: Database Setup Required

**You MUST run the updated SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:**

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `complete-schema.sql`
4. Run the SQL to update the RLS policies

## Key Changes Made:

### RLS Policy Updates:
```sql
-- Old (restrictive)
CREATE POLICY "Users can create bookings" ON public.bookings
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- New (allows anonymous users)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can create bookings" ON public.bookings
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
```

### Mobile Improvements:
- Form inputs now have `p-4 text-base` for better touch targets
- Modal uses responsive padding: `p-4 sm:p-6`
- Date/time grid is now responsive: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`
- All inputs have focus states: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500`
- Buttons have minimum height: `min-h-[48px]` and `min-h-[56px]`

## Testing:

1. The development server is running on http://localhost:3001
2. Test booking creation on both desktop and mobile
3. Verify translations work in both English and Arabic
4. Check that the booking form is mobile-friendly

## Translation Status:
âœ… All translations are properly configured in:
- `public/locales/en/common.json`
- `public/locales/ar/common.json`

The booking system should now work properly for anonymous users and provide a much better mobile experience!
